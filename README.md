# Hi there, I'm Viktoriia! 👋  
🌟 *Aspiring Frontend Developer with UX/UI design experience, passionate about programming and learning.*

### 🎓 Studying at [Hive](https://www.hive.fi/en/):
- At Hive, I’m learning C and C++ programming, focusing on foundational topics like variables, control flows, and object-oriented programming. I’m also studying Data Structures & Algorithms, Concurrent Programming (using threads and processes), and currently working on a Graphics Programming project to develop a 3D game with ray tracing techniques

### 📚 Taking the **Full Stack Developer** course by [Open University of Helsinki](https://fullstackopen.com/):
- During the Full Stack Developer course, I gained experience in front-end development, building dynamic SPAs and working with backend technologies to create and connect RESTful APIs to databases. I also focused on writing tests and applying Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure code reliability and quality.
