**Hi there 👋**

I’m a full-stack developer with a background in UX/UI design. I’ve always been passionate about creating intuitive and accessible interfaces, and now I’m bringing that passion into software development. I take ownership of my work, like to explore new tools and approaches to deliver high quality work, and believe in learning by doing and sharing with others.

## 🚀 Check these projects out
### [Camagru](https://github.com/vkuznets23/camagru.git) **(in progress)**

* Instagram clone built with Next.js (TypeScript), PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, Cloudinary, and Vercel. Features include email-verified signup, photo uploads, likes, comments, user search, infinite scrolling, and dark mode.
* One of my first major projects completed during the Hive mentorship program, where I handled everything—from design and frontend to backend and deployment.

### [Portfolio website](https://github.com/vkuznets23/portfolio.git)
* My portfolio website features interactive and accessible design, including language and theme switching with light and dark modes.
* I focused on accessibility and VoiceOver support, implemented a custom typography tool to handle hanging prepositions, and carefully designed animations triggered by scroll observers for a smooth user experience.
