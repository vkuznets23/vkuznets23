**Hi there 👋**

I’m a career shifter currently studying web development at Hive Helsinki. With a background in UX/UI design, I’ve always been passionate about creating intuitive and engaging user experiences — and now I’m bringing that passion into frontend development, where I'm building user-centric products that not only work well but also feel great to use.
