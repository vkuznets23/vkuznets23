## üíª About Me
I'm an aspiring Frontend Developer with a solid foundation in UX/UI design and a growing passion for building user-centric web applications. Currently, I‚Äôm studying at **Hive Helsinki**, where I‚Äôm diving deep into low-level programming with **C** and **C++**, exploring concepts like data structures, object-oriented programming, and concurrent programming.

In parallel, I‚Äôm also completing the **Full Stack Web Development program** at the University of Helsinki, where I've built dynamic **Single Page Applications** (SPAs), connected **RESTful APIs** to databases, and practiced Test-Driven Development (TDD) to write maintainable, production-ready code.
