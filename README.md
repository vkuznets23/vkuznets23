# Hi there, I'm Viktoriia! üëã  
üåü **Aspiring Frontend Developer with UX/UI design experience, passionate about programming and learning.**

## üíª About My Journey
üéì Studying at **Hive**:  
- Exploring Imperative Programming in C, mastering fundamentals like variables, control flows, and tackling complex projects.
- Advancing in Object-Oriented Programming in C++, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Diving into Data Structures & Algorithms to write efficient code and solve complex problems.
- Learning Concurrent Programming to optimize performance with threads and processes while ensuring synchronization.

**--> Currently working on a Graphics Programming project, using ray tracing techniques to develop a 3D game.**
  
üìö Taking the **Full Stack Developer** course by [Open University of Helsinki](https://fullstackopen.com/):  
**Part 1:** Learned the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Started building simple static web pages and got an introduction to the fundamentals of client-side scripting.
**Part 2:** Dive into React, understanding components, state, and props. Built dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) using React and learned about component-based architecture.
**Part 3:** Explored backend development with Node.js and Express, learning how to create RESTful APIs and interact with databases like MongoDB. Built full-stack applications by connecting front-end React applications to backend services.
**--> Currently in Part 4:** Testing, where I'm focusing on:
  - Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library for frontend code.
  - Integration testing for backend APIs using tools like Supertest.
  - Learning best practices for Test-driven development (TDD) and how to write tests to ensure reliability and improve code quality.
