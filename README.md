**Hi there 👋**

I’m a career shifter currently studying web development at Hive Helsinki. With a background in UX/UI design, I’ve always been passionate about creating intuitive and engaging user experiences — and now I’m bringing that passion into frontend development.

### [Camagru](https://github.com/vkuznets23/camagru.git) **(in progress)**

Built an Instagram-like full-stack web application entirely from scratch, handling all aspects from UI/UX design and responsive layout to backend architecture and deployment. Features include secure user authentication with email verification, photo uploads via Cloudinary, likes, comments, user search, infinite scrolling, and dark mode.
Developed the frontend with Next.js (TypeScript) and custom CSS, and implemented a scalable backend using Next.js API Routes, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM. Designed and optimized adaptive layouts for seamless cross-device performance. Integrated Cloudinary for efficient media delivery and set up CI/CD pipelines on Vercel for frictionless deployments.
Ensured code quality and stability with comprehensive testing — unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library) and end-to-end tests (Playwright).

### [ft_transcendence](https://github.com/vkuznets23/ft_transcendence.git) **(in progress)**
A classic Pong game implemented using React and TypeScript. Features customizable paddle sizes, adjustable difficulty levels, and dynamic obstacles for an extra challenge. Responsive controls support keyboard input for two players. This project demonstrates canvas rendering, game loop logic, and state management within a React functional component.
