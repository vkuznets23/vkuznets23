###About me ðŸ‘‹
I'm an aspiring Frontend Developer with UX/UI designer experience. I am currently studying coding at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/about-hive/) and actively expanding my skills through a [Full Stack Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/) Open University course at Helsinki University.


### ðŸŽ“ Studying at **Hive**:
At Hive Iâ€™m learning C and C++ programming, focusing on foundational topics (e.g. variables, control flows, and object-oriented programming). Iâ€™m also studying Data Structures & Algorithms, Concurrent Programming (using threads and processes). **Currently I'm working on a Graphics Programming project to develop a 3D game with ray tracing techniques**

### ðŸ“š Taking the **Full Stack Developer** course:
During the course I gained experience in front-end development, building dynamic SPAs, and working with backend technologies to create and connect RESTful APIs to databases. **Currently, I'm focused on writing tests and applying Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure code reliability and quality.**
